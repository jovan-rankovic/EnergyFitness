# EnergyFitness
Fitness club presentation and blog.

This site was made for my second PHP course at the beginning of 2019.
Here I learnt Laravel, Eloquent, Artisan, Middleware, Requests, logs, routing system, MVC design pattern, etc.
We were not allowed to use premade authentification, so I made it myself, without remember token.
